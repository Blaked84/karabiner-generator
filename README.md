# Karabiner config generator
> Small DSL to easily modify [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) configuration

The idea is to make a small language with first class support for variables, sticky key and simultaneous key definitions that will then generate [JSON that Karabiner can understand](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/json.html).

This project is in idea phase. Take a look at [issues](../../issues/) to see what things I hope to add to it soon.

## Specification
### Variables
If variable starts with `km_`, replace the variable:
`km_clone_github_repo = 'g: clone GitHub repo'`
with:
`osascript -e 'tell application "Keyboard Maestro Engine" do script "g: clone GitHub repo" end tell`

If variable starts with `alf_`, replace the variable:
`alf_search_lobsters = 'lobsters', 'nikivi.search-the-web'`
with:
`osascript -e 'tell application "Alfred 3" to run trigger "lobsters" in workflow "nikivi.search-the-web" with argument ""'`

If variable does not start with either `alf_` or `km_`, save whatever string is added to the var.

### Sticky key
Will make `s -> a` trigger whatever is in km_clone_github_repo variable.
`s.a = km_clone_github_repo`

Will make `s -> b` write `TODO: ` as series of chars. (S) = Shift being held down. (CT) = Ctrl beild held down.
(S/CT) = Shift + Ctrl being held down
`s.b = T (S) | O (S) | D (S) | O (S) | : | Space`

### Simultaneous keys
Will make j + k pressed together trigger km_clone_github_repo variable.
`j/k = km_clone_github_repo`
